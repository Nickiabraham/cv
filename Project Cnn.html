    <h3>*Objective</h3>
    <p>Skin cancer is the Most commonly Diagnosed cancer in many countries, and most cases are preventable.
        Skin cancer greatly affects the quality of life, and it can be Sisfiguring or even  deadly.
        This model is to diagnose skin cancer as well as classifies it into various classes through CNN.
    </p><hr>
    <h3>*Existing Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Resnet-50</li>
        <li>VGG-16</li>
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>*Drawbacks of existing method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Resnet-50 and VCG-16 architecture needs nearly 10,000 images in each category for training.</li>
        <li>The learning in the Resnet-50 might be very Difficult.</li>
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>*Proposed Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The Convolutional Neural Network algorithm where the architecture can be modified.</li>
        <li>Own architecture is proposed to detect the skin cancer using CNN.</li>
        <li>It consists of the layers hidden and convolutional layers.</li>
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>*Methodology</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Importing required libraries(Tensorflow,pickle,Keras.)</li>
        <li>Preparing Sequential model that is forming the layers order by order.</li>
        <li>Using softmax to round off the value.</li>
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>*Results</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The model's overall accuracy is about 99%</li>
        <li>CNN features are applied to machine learning algorithm to acheive better performance.</li>
        <li>The accuracy will depend upon the dataset, pre-processing set,and the System.</li>
